              We are working on a device that aims to spot unusual
              behaviors while riding motorcycles. Our goal is to
              recognize situations where a person might not be in
              the best condition to ride safely. This involves detecting
              possible influences of substances like alcohol or drugs,
              and also identifying drivers who have been on the road for
              extended periods without a break. Our mission is to enhance
              road safety by preventing risky situations and encouraging
              responsible driving habits.
